## What I do 
I'm really interested in theoretical computer science and the deep rooted intersection between mathematics and computer science (especially with programming languages!) I want to learn more about category theory and type theory. During my free time I enjoy [*good* movies](https://letterboxd.com/Vinnely/) and some [**normal** music](https://bandcamp.com/jpvinnely).
