## What's my catch? [Resume](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-paul-v-ramos-6268bb208/)
I'm really interested in theoretical computer science and the deep rooted intersection between mathematics and computer science. My research areas with experience include [programming language development](https://github.com/jpVinnie/diffeq-lang), [some pure math](https://github.com/jpVinnie/Research-Projects/tree/master/Pythagorean-Triples-in-the-Pascal-Triangle), and computational complexity. I want to learn more about quantum computing and artificial intelligence.
